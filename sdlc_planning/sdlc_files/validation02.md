## **Prompt question** ##
After reviewing the user stories and use cases we prepared, to what extent do these describe and resolve your previous problems with Flockr?

## *Response - written* ##
I have found your video calling use case and user stories to be highly useful and suit my needs perfectly, especially when you have also taken into account the higher-level video calling features like camera and microphone control, screen sharing, and host privileges. It seems to reflect my experience in Microsoft Teams well, and it resolves my previous problems with Flockr to a large extent.

I also saw that Epic 2 and its user stories cover my previous concern with the lack of direct messaging, and your user acceptance criteria seem to cover my needs well.

I recall previously that I also found the file sharing a problem previously unsolved by Flockr, and I feel that your use case diagram for file sharing mostly reflects the standard approach taken by other mainstream apps including Teams. However, I do feel that the 30-day link expiry period is a bit restrictive, and I believe many users would want to either have their shared files stored in the channel indefinitely, or, if it were to expire, choose the expiry period themselves.
