## **Prompt question** ##
After reviewing the user stories and use cases we prepared, to what extent do these describe and resolve your previous problems with Flockr?

## *Response - verbal (transcribed)* ##
They seem to be pretty good. I see that you added file sharing and direct messaging and they seem to work just as I'm used to. You also added direct messaging and a bunch of other messaging related stuff as well and it brings it closer to the other popular mainstream apps. So yeah it pretty much solves my previous gripes with your app and I reckon it is pretty close to being able to replace Discord for me. Yeah and file sharing is good for sharing memes and stuff with friends.

The video call use case looks to be useful enough to me. Like it is still different to what I'm used to in Discord, but I guess I can disable the camera to have voice calls when I'm gaming. 

The channel grouping thing is kinda different to what Discord servers do, but I guess it is still useful to me. I actually like the fact that your app is taking a simpler approach and you told me as well that it is more for productivity stuff than what Discord is used for.
