# **Product:** Flockr #

## **Epic 1:** Grouping channels ##
### **User story 1.1** ###
As a user of Flockr who uses multiple channels for a similar purpose, I want to be able to group those channels together so that my channels list appears more organised.

### *Task 1.1* ###
Create new channel grouping system where channels are grouped by their IDs and channel group names can be user-defined (ex: Work, School, Friends, etc.).

### **User story 1.2** ###
As a user of Flockr who uses different channels for different purpose, I don't want the addition of channel grouping to disrupt my current workflow in any way because I use Flockr for important work-related activities.

### *Task 1.2* ###
Ensure the channel grouping system is opt-in, such that users will not experience a functional change in their use of Flockr until they actively create and use a channel group. This means that the original purpose of channels should not change, and channel groups act merely as a "folder" for channels, without any additional channel-like functionality.

## **Epic 2:** Advanced messaging features ##
### **User story 2.1** ###
As a user of Flockr, I want the ability to send direct messages so that I can privately message another user instead of putting the message in channels.

### *Task 2.1* ###
Add the ability to send other users direct messages independent of channels.

### **User story 2.2** ###
As a user of Flockr, I want to be able to see the status of a message after it has been sent so that I know when the other user(s) have received and/or seen it.

### *Task 2.2* ###
Add the ability to see the status of a message after it has been sent. Three statuses specifically: sent, delivered/received, seen.

## **Epic 3:** File sharing in channels and direct messages ##
### **User story 3.1** ###
As a user of Flockr, I want to be able to share files in channels and direct messages so I can collaborate better with my team and eliminate the need to email files to other users.

### *Task 3.1* ### 
Add the ability for users to send and receive files in channels and direct messages.

### **User story 3.2** ###
As a user of Flockr, I want to be able to see and download files I have shared in the past as part of the message history so I don't have to keep resending the same files.

### *Task 3.2* ###
Add some form of *longer*-term file persistence/storage to Flockr.

## **Epic 4:** Real-time audiovisual communication ##
### **User story 4.1** ###
As a user of Flockr, I want to be able to host video conferences in Flockr to replace conventional collaboration methods such as face-to-face meetings.

### *Task 4.1* ###
Add ability to have real-time video calls/conferences between multiple users in channels or between two users in direct messages.

### **User story 4.2** ###
As a user of Flockr, I want to be able to have audio-only calls for quick and informal meetings where there is no need to appear in front of a camera.

### *Task 4.2* ###
Add ability to turn off the camera in video calls/conferences.

### **User story 4.3** ###
As a user of Flockr, I want to be able to mute my mic and turn off my camera before joining a meeting to avoid causing any disruption.

### *Task 4.3* ###
Add panel to check and set audio and video settings after clicking on 'join call' button, but prior to actually joining the call.

### **User story 4.4** ###
As the host of a video call in Flockr, I want to have the option to record the calls as video or audio files so that any non-participants have access to information shared during the meeting.

### *Task 4.4* ###
Add the option to record video calls as video or audio files, but only to the host of each meeting or a Flockr owner.

### **User story 4.5** ###
As a participant of a video call, I want the option to share my screen to other participants so that they can all see the same thing I am referring to, just like in a face-to-face meeting.

### *Task 4.5* ###
Add the option for screen-sharing by any participant during a video call.

### **User story 4.6** ###
As the host of a video call, I want to be able to manage participants so that I can mute or remove any participant, to combat any trolling behaviour that often plagues the world of online conferencing.

### *Task 4.6* ###
Give the host of video calls the ability to mute or remove any participant.

### **User story 4.7** ###
As the host of a video call, I want to be able to transfer host privileges to any participant, in the case where I have started the video call but is not supposed to act as the host of the meeting.

### *Task 4.7* ###
Add the ability for the host of video calls to transfer host status to any other participant. Once transferred, host status is removed from the current user to ensure there is only one host in each video conference.
