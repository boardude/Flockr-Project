<br/>

**YMZ:** Do you currently use any teamwork-driven communication tools?

**PZ:** What's that?

**YMZ:** Like any program where you can talk or interact with a bunch of other people in real-time, like Discord for example. You use Discord right?

**PZ:** Yeah.

**YMZ:** So what do you use Discord for mainly?

**PZ:** Talk with my friends. Mostly when we're playing Valorant and Fortnite. And yeah, it's pretty important that we talk through Discord to give out comms when we're playing these competitive fps games.

**YMZ:** So being able to communicate via real-time audio would be pretty important to you as a user of Discord?

**PZ:** Yeah defs.

**YMZ:** Besides using it for talking with teammates in team-based video games, what else do you use Discord for?

**PZ:** Just as a general messaging app when I'm not playing games with friends.

**YMZ:** So would you have what's called channels where you and your friends message each other? 

**PZ:** Yeah. So I would have different servers for say, different groups of friends. Or a better way of putting it is there are different servers for different groups of interest. 

**YMZ:** Can you give me an example of how you would use a server?

**PZ:** Like, I joined a video editing server to chat and talk to other people who have a similar interest in video editing, and we would share clips of what we've edited with each other and give feedback. I would have another server with people from my school, and a server for just my friend group. 

**YMZ:** How are the servers in Discord related to channels? Are they the same thing?

**PZ:** Inside each server would be a list of different channels, and each channel can be either text or voice. Each channel would be used for a different purpose. 

**YMZ:** That's interesting. So Discord servers are basically like a channel of channels?

**PZ:** Yeah you can think of it like that. 

**YMZ:** Would you mind trying Flockr for 5 to 10 minutes and compare this experience with your routine on Discord?

**PZ:** Yeah okay.

*After PZ uses Flockr for 10 minutes*

**YMZ:** What's your initial impression of Flockr?

**PZ:** Definitely looks and feels a bit bare compared to Discord. It's surprisingly fast, and the basic functionality is defs there, but there's a lot that could be done to make it better.

**YMZ:** What are some of these things you feel that could be added to Flockr to make it a viable Discord-replacement for you?

**PZ:** Well as I've said, I would definitely feel that adding servers or at least having channels of channels would be a major improvement. Also being able to add someone as a friend so you can have a friends list, and, direct messaging, yeah, that would be good as well. 

**YMZ:** That's a great point. Direct messaging between users can be done right now on Flockr by creating a private channel between you and another user you want to dm, but it's finnicky and either person can just invite people to join the dm, which breaks its purpose.

**PZ:** Yeah.

**YMZ:** And I'm guessing your point on being able to add friends is related to direct messaging?

**PZ:** Not really. I like the system that Instagram, Messenger, and all the other social apps have with direct messaging. You can send strangers a message request, and engage in a conversation with them if you choose to, or decline their message request to stop them from sending messages to you for a while. Yeah but for friends you can dm with no restriction. Also you should be able to block people on your app as well.

**YMZ:** Would you consider file sharing be an important feature to add for Flockr? 

**PZ:** Oh yeah I forgot to mention that. It is defs important to me when I'm trying to share memes with friends or just like files in general with people. And it would be a deal-breaker not to have that.

**YMZ:** My final question is on how you feel about managing user permissions on Flockr.

**PZ:** Wait you can do that?

**YMZ:** Yeah it's on the top right corner if you click on the admin button.

**PZ:** Oh, so how does it work. 

**YMZ:** There are two permissions, owners and members. The first user who registers on Flockr would be the Flockr owner, and everyone after that would be a member. The owner can change the permissions of other users, from member to owner or the other way around. Also, if you created a channel, you are the owner in that channel even if you are not an owner of Flockr. Flockr owners are considered owners in all channels they join. 

**PZ:** Wow that sounds so weird. Having Flockr owners and that.

**YMZ:** So what would be your suggestion as a long-time user of Discord?

**PZ:** I mean having something like a Discord owner, the admin of the entire app, would just be confusing unless used in a place like school or work. I feel like if you introduce servers into your app, and then just have owners of servers who can change permissions of other users who've joined the server, that would make more sense.

**YMZ:** Thanks for the feedback. That's all I have. Do you have anything else to add?

**PZ:** Nup.
