*This is a full interview transcript*

<br/>

**YMZ:** Do you currently use any teamwork-driven communication apps?

**BV:** Does Microsoft Teams count?

**YMZ:** Yeah of course. 

**BV:** I use Microsoft Teams for online classes. I would have lectures and tutorials as video conferences in Teams.

**YMZ:** So would you consider the ability to communicate via real-time video important for a team-based communication app?

**BV:** Yeah definitely. Otherwise because listening to lectures is my primary use of Teams.

**YMZ:** Do you use Teams for anything else?

**BV:** Sometimes when I have to work as a team on stuff like assignments, we usually collaborate over teams. What I think your app calls a channel is called a "team" in Teams, but they do mostly the same stuff. Like sending messages into a group chat, sending files to each other, and sometimes we have voice calls in the channel.

**YMZ:** How about you try to use Flockr for a few minutes and tell me what you think?

**BV:** Yeah sure.

*After BV uses Flockr for 10 minutes*

**YMZ:** So what do you think? Can Flockr replace Microsoft Teams for you?

**BV:** Not really. Some key features I use on a daily basis are missing from Flockr. For one video and audio conferencing aren't there and I can't share files in the Flockr channels. But messaging seems fine.

**YMZ:** Would you consider the ability to communicate via real-time audio and video, and file sharing, to be crucial features for team-based communication apps like Flockr and Teams?

**BV:** Yeah, yeah definitely. I mean especially if you want the app to replace face-to-face collaboration.

**YMZ:** Anything else you want to add? If Flockr were to have real-time audio and video and file sharing, would it replace Teams for you?

**BV:** I mean yeah pretty much, besides maybe a UI redesign. But I can use it like that.

**YMZ:** Great. I am now going to ask you a series of questions on other potential features we might add.

**BV:** Sure.

**YMZ:** On a scale of 1 to 10, how important do you think having direct messaging capabilities is to an app like Flockr or Teams?

**BV:** Hmm...I'd say a solid 8. I don't personally use it a lot since I talk to my team in the "team" group chat or channels as your app calls it. But I definitely understand the need of direct messaging, maybe as a means of talking to a team member privately.

**YMZ:** On a scale of 1 to 10, how important do you think being able to add other users into a "friends" list is?

**BV:** To me...I'd say a 3. Because I don't personally use a friends list or add anyone as a friend, and Teams itself doesn't have this feature anyway. I just need to be able to add people into a chat by their username or email and that's all good.

**YMZ:** So this is a follow up. How important do you think the ability to block or blacklist other users is on a scale of 1 to 10?

**BV:** Again I'd say a 3. In Teams there isn't really a need to block users. You just create a channel and invite other people to join your channel. You can remove them from your channel and that would have the same effect as blocking them. You won't hear from them until you invite them again. You know, just keep things simple.

**YMZ:** On a scale of 1 to 10, how important do you think being able to for users to see the statuses of other users is?

**BV:** What do you mean...like the green dot to show they're online and orange dot to...

**YMZ:** Yeah, that sort of thing.

**BV:** I'd say a 7. Not really essential, but I'd say it's a nice feature to have for any modern mainstream collaboration app. 

**YMZ:** On a scale of 1 to 10, how important do you think being able to see the status of messages after they've been sent is? On Teams I think you can see two ticks for when a message is delivered and an eye icon for when it has been read by other people.

**BV:** Probably a 6. Again not an essential feature but definitely nice to have.

**YMZ:** Great, that's all the questions I have for you today. Anything else to add?

**BV:** Yeah I mean I would rank audio and video as 10 out of 10, and file sharing probably as an 8 or 9, but besides that not much else to say.

**YMZ:** Great, thanks for your input.
